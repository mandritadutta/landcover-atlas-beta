Landcover Atlas (Beta)
This is a simple web-based project I made using only HTML and CSS. It is a visual dashboard to represent India’s land cover. The idea is to build something that can help people understand land use patterns across the country. This version is just a starting point.

What this is about
This project simulates a public dashboard that might be used by people without technical backgrounds, like school students or community users. It doesn’t use JavaScript or any backend tools — just plain HTML and CSS to keep it lightweight and easy to maintain.

What’s inside the folder
index.html – the main web page

styles.css – the design and layout

Some data and image files are stored locally but not pushed to GitHub because they’re too large

I had to remove files like .tif and .rrd because GitHub doesn’t allow files over 100 MB. But the code is still set up to work with those types of files if added manually.

What can be added later
Map overlays

Image preview panels

Interactive legends

A section where users can upload data

More land classification types (e.g., urban, forest, water)

Why I built this
I come from a geospatial background and wanted to show how my skills in that field can connect with basic web development. This project is part of my portfolio to demonstrate that I can bridge data and design for public or scientific purposes.

Status
This is a beta version. It is meant to be improved over time, but it already shows the structure and intent clearly.
